Hi Magnus,

Thank you for connecting with EWB-SWE. 

Your time and expertise can make a valuable difference in people's lives. There are a variety of ways to get involved with the organisation. 

By connecting with us, we get the opportunity to get to know you better. Start with introducing yourself in your personal profile. We will 
keep you updated with engagements that suit your profile.

Most of our engagements are volunteer positions. 

If you are not already a member of our organisation, you can find more information here. 

Don't find a position that you are interested in?

Connect with one of our local groups. Joining a group is an opportunity to participate in various projects and activities, to inspire, 
reflect and act towards our common goals. Contact the group leader of the closest group in your area.  

Have a great day!
